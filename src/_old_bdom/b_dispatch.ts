 * Block Dispatch
 *
 * Most of the time, we can assume that we deal with something having a given
 * structure, even if we do not know exactly what it is. For example, multiple
 * consecutive execution of t-call="sometemplate" lead to a unknown bdom, but
 * each of them with the same structure.
 *
 * However, in some dynamic cases, it is not even possible to guarantee that two
 * consecutive calls will have the same shape: for example, a dynamic t-call
 * such as t-call="{{someTemplate}}" or a t-slot="{{dynamicSlot}}" can lead to
 * two arbitrary different structure.  In those case, we can use the BDispatch
 * block to make the transition.
